Tiny tray app that lets you close your laptop and still work on the Monitor.
Simply control what happens when you close your laptop lid. Go to sleep or do nothing to work on your desktop monitor.


## States

### The app has two simple states:

1. <u> OFF (Red Icon) -</u> when you close the lid, your laptop will go to sleep as the default behavior.
2. <u> ON (Green Icon) -</u> when you close the lid, your laptop will not go to sleep and you can work on your desktop monitor.

* Switch between the two States by right clicking the tray icon, and selecting "Change State".
