Simply control what happens when you close your laptop lid. Go to sleep or do nothing to work on your desktop monitor.


## States
### The app has two simple states:

1. <u> OFF (Red Icon) -</u> when you close the lid, your laptop will go to sleep as the default behavior.
2. <u> ON (Green Icon) -</u> when you close the lid, your laptop will not go to sleep and you can work on your desktop monitor.

* Switch between the two States by clicking the tray Icon. you can also use right click, and selecting "Change State".
